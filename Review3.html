    <h1> 1, Outcome 3 (Review) </h1>

<h2> 
    Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of 
    productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
</h2>

<p>
    I could have been more efficient with my time by knowing what I wanted to do and adding it to tell so I could stick to a time line properly.
    I believe it is possible to do a website in teams if properly planned and executed using the tools we have been given.
</p>

<h3>
    3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.
</h3>
 
<p>
    A clear and decisive plan and stick to it using Trello. Set a time frame for each task i.e. know the topic, make the background and heading match the subject.
</p>

<h4>
    3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what 
    would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? 
</h4>

<p>
Next time would make a blank HTML file to make the process of making each page quicker.
</p>

<h4>
    3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.
</h4>

<p>
I would download and try them out in the appropriate applications. The best way to test something is to try it out and see if its fit for the project but don’t use
Or try them out when you are on a tight deadline, do it in your spare on a private project.
