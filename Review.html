    <h2>
            2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
            
    </h2>

        <p>
             In making my website there was a lot of trial and error pun intended. Over all the tools I used were perfect for the task I was trying to perform, although I think I could have planned my project better on Trello as I have now had to make a new project board that reflects my work, I have learned now to be more thoughtful of what I’m doing and how I aim to achieve the goals I set.

    <h3>
        2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.
    </h3>

    <p>

            The tools I used most where Visual studio code and Google to work out what I wanted do and get the out come I desired.
            My lecturer was a really great resource and helpful in making me realise the finer points in my coding making sure I paid close attention to the details. 
            Over all the tools and resources I used are amazing at what they do and are very appropriate for the task I have done.

        2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project.
    </h4>

    <p>

        The strength of my website is that it is simple, easy to read and navigate. 
        The weaknesses due to my current skill, time frame given are that it is not very interactive and truly fitting for the topic at hand although it may look nice against a plank web page.
    </p>

    <h5>
        2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.
    </h5>

    <p>
        I would plan my project properly on Trello next time and use the resources I have at my disposal much more efficiently.
        These thing though are as I have come to find in real terms are better defined when you have a client with a clear or even a ruff idea of what they want.
